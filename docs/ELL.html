<div class="story-body scrollytelling"> <h2>From 2016, the Bronx saw former English Langauge Learners start outperforming native speakers. Let's break his down into small multiples to see how individual schools did in this period.</h2> <p>I reverse engineered this design idea from <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/06/05/upshot/how-the-recession-reshaped-the-economy-in-255-charts.html">the New York Times</a>.</p> <p>Since 2016, the Bronx has seen former English Langauge Learners start outperforming native speakers. Start scrolling to see how it works!</p> <div id="chart-4" class="chart"> </div> <div class="steps"> <div class="step" id="step-centered"> <h2>These are 66 public schools in the Bronx that reported data for every year between 2014-2019. There are 117 schools in the Bronx in total.</h2> <p>Each line represents the performance of former English Language Learners — known as Ever ELLs — between 2014 and 2019 in 8th Grade ELA. The lines are colored based on whether performance has increased or decreased relative to performance in 2014 and how sharp this increase/decrease is. Lines are also positioned on the x axis based on the number of former English Language Learners students in each school; schools further to the right have more of these students. The biggest gains — colored in dark green — were made in schools with a lot of former English language students or relatively few, and the preponderance of green shows that most schools saw improvements.</p> </div> <div class="step" id="step-jobs"> <p>Now that we have an idea of how each school improved relative to its own performance in 2014, let's compare them with each other. I'm moving schools out on the y axis based on how many former English Language Learners achieved a passing grade or more. Schools that are higher saw a higher graduation rate in 2019; the median graduation rate — represented by the schools clustered in the middle — was 45 percent. The lowest performing schools which saw decreased performance over this period also had relatively few ELL students.</p> </div> <div class="step" id="step-highlight"> <p>Here, green lines are schools where "Ever ELLs" outperformed "Never ELLs" in 2019. The majority of schools in this sample saw former English Language Learners outperform native speakers, especially in the top of the pack.</p> </div> <div class="step" id="step-final"> <p>In 2016, these students first began outperforming native speakers, and this population has led borough-wide by a 9-10 percent margin over the past two years.</p> <p>Our story starts with Donald Hertz, highlighted here.</p> </div> </div>
</div> <script src="ELL.b65e73be.js"></script> <div class="story-body"> <p>Imagine that this sentence is difficult for you to read. Stop. Circle a word, and then look up what it means. Look up how to sound it out. Write out the definition, and for good measure translate it into a language with which you are more familiar. And repeat.</p> <p>Around 70 predominantly Arabic-speaking students in Ron Mccormick’s class at Donald Hertz Middle School in the Bronx do this in their lessons. It can be frustrating work that demands diligence, discipline and maturity; many of his students stay after school to continue to work on their language skills. Students who successfully exit the English Language Learner program are “by nature students who are more determined, more hardworking,” Mccormick said. To him, it’s no wonder that they go on to outperform native speakers in English language assessments.</p> <p>“I’ve always said that when they’re nurtured, they’re usually the people who turn into valedictorians,” Mccormick said. For the past three years, former English language learners in the Bronx have led the field in 8th Grade English assessments. For context, in Brooklyn this trend has held true since at least 2014, while former English language learners in Manhattan, Queens and Staten Island do about as well as their counterparts.</p> <p>English Language Learners comprised about 22 percent of public school students in the Bronx in 2016, the highest percentage by county in New York State. All English Language Learners are entitled to special language services, which typically continue for five or six years, said Jacqueline Valentin, an ENL teacher of about two decades at P.S. Port Morris in the Bronx, where a third of test takers are English Language Learners and another third were formerly classified as such.</p> <p>Most English Language Learners at P.S. Morris test out of the program after six years; Valentin estimated that less than ten percent of these students at her school stay in the program long-term. After they exit, these students’ performance is tracked separately for another two years, and they are still entitled to receive services if they so choose.</p> <p>“When you continue to follow that student, and you see their performance, you're seeing how they are continuing to grow, and then learn, and then outperform," said Mirza Sanchez-Medina, Deputy Chief Academic Officer for Multilingual Learners to Spectrum News in October. These students are also tracked separately as they are given special accommodations, which can range from extra time on a test to a glossary of terms.</p> <p>The majority of schools that consistently reported data for this demographic over the past five years saw improvements in their performance. Valentin attributes this to two factors: policy change and the strategies that ENL specialized teachers have developed for their students.</p> <p>In 2014, the New York State Education Department released updated Commissioner Regulations to ensure that advanced English language learners were taught in integrated classrooms. These guidelines went into effect in the 2015-16 school year, said Susan Lafond of New York State United Teachers.</p> <p>Instructors have to be certified to teach content and language skills or general education teachers partner with specialized English teachers, Valentin said. The change prevents students from having to leave classrooms and lose instruction — often in the form of vocabulary — that their peers would acquire, Valentin said.</p> <p>Parallel teaching also has the ability to bring out great creativity in teachers and allow them to share specialized knowledge, said Dr. Dilshad Dayani, professor at Teachers College, Columbia University. It’s a great way to “use the resources in the community,” she said.</p> <p>Valentin said that general education teachers aren’t taught to differentiate lesson objectives in the same way that a teacher of English learners does. The latter try multiple methods of communicating information in a single lesson because they often have students of different skill levels in a room. Diversifying teaching methods and classroom deliverables does not constitute a dumbing down of the material, Valentin stressed. “They still learned the same thing but the way it was taught was different,” she said.</p> <p>Consider, for instance, how an ENL teacher might break up a lesson about a dense piece of text. “The text might not be at the level of all the kids,” Valentin said, so she starts out by presenting a preview of its contents. She then reads the text aloud to them and provides some students with a word bank. Students then turn and talk to one another or develop visuals of what they’ve read to reinforce their comprehension.</p> <p>Mccormick is a fan of jigsaw reading, where students pick different paragraphs in a text to digest separately. Students who are struggling are given fewer words to contend with, but eventually everyone comes together to share out what they learned with the whole group. In the end, “there’s a better feeling in the classroom,” he said. Traditional instruction that puts the teacher center might work for the “cream of the crop” but many children “get lost in the shuffle,” he said.</p> <p>The Next Generation Learned Standards, which were adopted in 2017 by NYSED, place a premium on the strategies taught to English learners and encourage General Education teachers to adopt them in their lesson planning, Valentin said. In particular, they emphasize the four modalities of learning, a framework developed by researchers to encourage teachers to play to the strengths of visual, auditory, tactile and kinesthetic learners. In other words: some students might be better at understanding information when they see it, hear it, touch it or perform it in some fashion.</p> <p>“All of that I’m already including,” Valentin said, whereas general education teachers might not see differentiation as being as necessary in their field. “It’s not just for ELL students. It’s just a matter of good teaching.”</p> <p>It’s often difficult for teachers of English Language Learners to know what kind of impact their methods have in real time, Mccormick said. Like other teachers, they only have snapshots of student progress. But every now and then his students thank him for the work he puts into lesson planning, conscious that this is an opportunity that their parents’ didn’t necessarily have, Mccormick said. “There’s a sense of gratitude there.”</p> </div>
