</div> <div class="story-body"> <p>A current editor at my college paper asked me to look into basketball retention rates for men and women's teams at Brown to see if losing a third of the team each year is pretty common for teams. I scraped roster information from the Brown Athletics website using selenium and cleaned it with pandas. This is some of the stuff I found.</p> <p>You can find a link to my jupyter notebook with analysis and those lovely clean datasets <a href="https://github.com/kpananjady/Brown-basketball">here</a>.</p> <p>My thinking was, let's start with the seniors part of this picture. The team couldn't have avoided losing all of its seniors, so I wanted to see if the team had an unusually high percentage of seniors that year.</p>
<iframe title="Class composition of men's basketball team" aria-label="Stacked Bars" id="datawrapper-chart-ZvuJr" src="//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/ZvuJr/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width:0;min-width:100%!important;border:none;" height="366"></iframe><script>!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*='"+e+"']");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}})}();</script> <p>It looks as though the team is somewhat balanced between underclassmen and upperclassmen, and has been consistently so for the past 10 years (with the notable exception of 2018, where it looks like they couldn't recruit any freshmen, resulting in no sophomores this year). I wonder how they keep this balance.</p> <p>The next step of this is looking at unforced errors, i.e: how many non-seniors does the team lose?</p> <h2>Of the players who are not seniors, what percentage does the team lose each year?</h2> <p>The way to read this is: Going into the fall <code>insert year</code> season, what percent of non-seniors did the team lose? There are a few spikes in this data!</p> <div id="chart-1"></div> <p>These loss numbers would currently reflect people who studied abroad, took time off, were injured or chose not to return for other reasons. I'm working on isolating as many of these factors as I can at the moment.</p> <p>Of those who left, class year doesn't seem to be a predictive factor; rather, years of experience is. Most of those who leave have appeared on the team roster for a single year.</p>
