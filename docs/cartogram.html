</div> <div class="step" data-show-selector="#grid-step-0"><p> That’s a fancy way of saying the government should buy out property owners in flood-prone areas instead of repeatedly paying insurance claims to rebuild. But it’s complicated. Recent research shows the current buyout regime varies widely by state, does not correlate with where the damage is occuring, and might even bring with it a racial disparity. </p></div> <div class="step" data-show-selector="#grid-step-1"><p>Citing NOAA, a CNBC article states that “from 2016 to 2018, the average number of billion-dollar disasters totaled 15 each year, while the average for 1980–2018 was just 6.2 events per year.” A Federal Emergency Management Agency official quoted in the story makes the case that “the need for forward-leaning action is greater than ever before."</p> </div> <div class="step" data-show-selector="#grid-step-2"><p>Given the urgency of climate change, it’s surprising at first to discover that the overall numbers of buyouts in the country are decreasing. That is, until you disaggregate the data by state — a classic case of Simpson’s paradox, where the national trend obscures interesting local analyses. In 1993, Missouri and Illinois alone took over 5,000 buyouts due to storms and flooding, contributing to the trend’s all time high of 8,000. But while the participation of the Midwest in the program has steadily dwindled by hundreds, the program has seen steady if small upticks in participation among states on the East Coast.</p> </div> </div>

But a recent Science Advances study published in October raises concern about social equity in this context and suggests that buyouts don’t paint a simple picture of changing disaster zones. Rather, there are confounding variables that determine whether or not communities take buyouts, independent of the level of damage they might suffer — such as how white and wealthy they might be.</p></div> <div class="step" data-show-selector="#grid-step-3"><p>As a Houma Today editorial from October put it, “The top three states in total property damage are in the middle of the buyout pack. Florida had $98.8 billion in damage, Louisiana $85.4 billion and Mississippi $34.2 billion. Yet Florida is 24th in the number of homes purchased, Mississippi 22nd and Louisiana 19th, with a total of just over 2,000 buyouts in the three states.”</p></div> <div class="step" data-show-selector="#grid-step-3"><p>An NPR investigation from earlier this year found that buyouts disproportionately went to whiter and wealthier communities in the country. One reason for this might be that FEMA provides only 75 percent of the funding required to execute a buyout project. The findings of the October study complicate this picture slightly; researchers found that while the counties that participated in buyout programs tended to be wealthy, zipcodes in which buyouts where implemented were not necessarily so. This finding gives rise to concerns about urban displacement among vulnerable groups, and it wouldn’t be the first time; in post-Katrina New Orleans, the “green dot” redevelopment program caused great consternation among African American residents in the city.</p></div> <div class="step" data-show-selector="#grid-step-4"><p>If it is indeed true that large-scale buyouts need to be part of the conversation about climate change, making sure that we completely understand the social implications of their implementation so far needs to be a priority.</p> </div> </div>

<p>This data was obtained via FOIA request by NPR. I did my analysis in pandas, drew a house in Illustrator and drew on this d3 code <a href="https://bl.ocks.org/veltman/938ea2d0ef98c02633bec15d6fb3a177">here</a> for the force diagram. New Jersey is an interesting place to study this because the they also have a state run program. Check back here for updates on how my masters project is going!</p>
