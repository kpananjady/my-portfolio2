<br> <div class="story-body"> <br> <p>Bia passed away last week. I spent the past weekend reading everything she read and everything she wrote. I didn't come away with a lot of answers, but I did come away with a desire to preserve the words of someone I deeply admire.</p> <p>You can find all of Bia's published work on this page. You can also get a sense of the literary diet of someone who once listed "reading" as a skill on LinkedIn.</p>

Bia was a graduate student and instructor in the University of Oregon's Fiction MFA. I last saw her in New York about a year ago while she was working for her work permit to come through. About that summer, she wrote, "Between all the reading I’ve been doing, for work and for fun; volunteering at the New York Public Library; writing short stories and submitting a story, today, to a literary journal; living in the city; visiting bookstores and coffeeshops... Well, I’m not published yet. But I do feel as though I am living my dream." Her first short story was published a year ago, in December 2018.

I want to ask, and I think I say it, too: I think I demand a response from her.

'Talking about it can change everything,' one of them says. Yes, it can, and yet talking is often not enough. If you know your loved one is in need, you will have to do more than that. Offer your time, a listening ear, words of encouragement, or even better, if you can, your presence. Offer your patience and your nonjudgmental attention. Your perspective taking and empathy. Offer your company. Offer your love. And try to give that person hope.❤️ #letserasethestigma"</a></div> </div>
