I didn't come away with a lot of answers, but I did come away with a desire to preserve the words of someone I deeply admire. You can find all of Bia's published work on this page.</p>

Bia was a graduate student at the University of Oregon. I last saw her in New York about a year ago while she was working for her work permit to come through. About that summer, she wrote, "Between all the reading I’ve been doing, for work and for fun; volunteering at the New York Public Library; writing short stories and submitting a story, today, to a literary journal; living in the city; visiting bookstores and coffeeshops... Well, I’m not published yet. But I do feel as though I am living my dream." Her first short story was published a year ago, in December 2018. Click on her words to read them where they orginally appeared.

I do—“Maybe living permanently abroad, I feel like…” I sigh. “Like maybe I’m betraying Brazil.”</a></p>
<p>“Are you kidding?” Her response is immediate, because it has to be. “You wouldn’t be betraying anybody. You would be helping. You would be helping Brazil.”</p> <p>How? I want to ask, and I think I say it, too: I think I demand a response from her. I myself don’t believe it’s true, not in that moment, but it becomes clear to me, again, how important it is that someone I care about believe it, no—that precisely my mother believe it."</p> </div> <div class="step" data-show-selector="#grid-step-2"><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/7371881.Beatrice_Bugane">"It reminds me vaguely of my fascination with a squirrel I once saw swiftly running along a tree trunk.

It seems equally important, however, that students realize that seeking help from professional sources is not necessarily a sign of illness."</a></div> <div class="step" data-show-selector="#grid-step-5"><a href="http://www.acentosreview.com/November2018/beatrice-bugane.html">"...a man on the other side, dressed in a glittering, green cape, danced to Frank Sinatra’s New York, New York, which played loudly on a handheld radio.

Luciana wondered whether anything about her communicated any of this. She was decidedly not an extrovert, but she wanted desperately to appear Brazilian. As much as she had spent more recent years in life trying to be anything but, in her deepest of hearts she wanted that more than anything, to appear, to be, Brazilian."</a></div> <div class="step" data-show-selector="#grid-step-6"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/projectlets/photos/a.533734283371343/2602134039864680/?type=3&__xts__%5B0%5D=68.ARAjDQDH7i6jS49RRmwXmizPBOtR3h_aojrBVnL69y91n7dD5Cgzkmt57dtwDPlT0bxau1dOfXFpPJKJ6ReqPdBRGTJeq4UDpiRcOfUihtBS_03PK8Ma6muo0ipnhx9lYV5FZ9mJd5ebP-1HlP-EPCZEf59ywsEXzSzRDhe85XR-ZThn6ZVHPLtY5MF9kZUGMMrup_5CkvMAFWPF3nCFqjx5yTA9Cl06RMrJa2t3b3Zcg2qoAi9CutWxiVJNduB0NHGecbfBZe98Y1iDt9hFc6U1KmHhZ1BXGktneFQKHUc_Sc9uO_ohvWvkHMtJ1NFtCczOFgfETUK_kIFvEHz9Deu1IA&__tn__=-R">"Walked past Anthony Bourdain’s former restaurant today to see loving messages posted there in memory. 'Talking about it can change everything,' one of them says. Yes, it can, and yet talking is often not enough. If you know your loved one is in need, you will have to do more than that. Offer your time, a listening ear, words of encouragement, or even better, if you can, your presence. Offer your patience and your nonjudgmental attention. Your perspective taking and empathy. Offer your company. Offer your love. And try to give that person hope.❤️ #letserasethestigma"</a></div> </div>
