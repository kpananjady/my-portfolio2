<br> <main id="content">  <div class="story-body"> <p>Hi! My name is Kasturi Pananjady, and I am a data journalism master's student at Columbia University. I have previously worked at <a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/author/kasturipananjady/">The Brown Daily Herald</a>, <a href="https://thewire.in/caste/kakkoos-divya-bharathi-arrest-reasons">The Wire</a> and <a href="https://www.thehindu.com/profile/author/Kasturi-Pananjady/">The Hindu</a>. Those links should take you to the work I did there.</p> <p>This is a website where I'm documenting some of the fabulous things I am learning in class. I often go back and revise my work when I feel like I can do a better job, so expect some changes! For instance, this iteration of my portfolio tinkers a lot with interactivity and responsiveness. In the further work section of my projects I often mull over what I'd like to do next. If you have feedback, please send it my way so I can add it to my list of things I need to learn!</p> <p>P.S. I love pandas.</p> <h2>My personal projects</h2>
