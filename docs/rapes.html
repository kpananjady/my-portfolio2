</div> <div class="story-body scrollytelling"> <p>This data does not include the 2012 gangrape in Delhi. It also does not include the vet who was raped and burned in Hyderabad this month, nor does it include the woman who was raprd and burned by her alleged rapists on the way to testify at her rape hearing this month. Rapes that result in murder do not figure here, as the Indian government subsumes them under the more general category of homicides. As such, it is actually difficult to fully understand just how deadly rape in India can be. If there's one thing that I've learned in graduate school, it's that not counting something often amounts to being able to understand it.</p> <h3>As one prominent activist, Swati Maliwal, goes on hunger strike for legislative change, all eyes are on Delhi, colored in red.</h3> <h2>Meet the <i>Lok Sabha</i>, the Indian house of representatives.</h2> <p>The composition of the house changed in May as the incumbent Prime Minister seized a commanding majority.</p> <p>The Lok Sabha has seen heated debates on the subject of women's safety, ost notably in 2012 after the Delhi gangrape. Start scrolling to understand who our lawmakers are today.</p> <div id="chart-3" class="chart"> </div> <div class="steps"> <div class="step" id="parties1"> <p>There are 545 seats in the Lok Sabha. Here's how they were split between parties last year.</p> </div> <div class="step" id="parties2"> <p>This is what happened in the 2019 general election. Yellow is the ruling party, the National Democratic Alliance headed by the Bharatiya Janata Party. The United Progressive Alliance, led by the Indian National Congress is next in blue, followed by other parties in purple.</p> </div> <div class="step" id="crimes"> <p>The Indian general election had a historically high number of candidates contesting. Reuters did a great story on the criminal backgrounds of those running, accessible here.

This is how many women are in the house. Total. And this is the highest it has ever been.</p> </div> </div>
</div> <script src="parliament.708e5c3c.js"></script> <div class="story-body"> <p>Want to see if your MP has been charged with a crime? Type their name into this search box, or type the name of your state. [TK}</p> <p>In the aftermath of the 2012 Delhi gangrape, female MPs were some of the most vocal advocates for change. This time around, MPs have been accused of politicizing the issue and alienating those across the aisle — particularly when Smriti Irani said that opposition leader Rahul Gandhi condoned rape by mentioning the word in a speech condemning the prime minister's silence on the matter. Here's a representation of what polarization looks like among women in parliament — represented by the yellow dots — and what opportunities for regional coalition building may exist, represented by the purple dots. Circle are sized based on the number of edges going in and out of each node; also it's worth pointing out that while the absolute numbers of women MPs might differ between the two major parties, the BJP and the Congress, as a percentage of ther members the parties are not so far apart at 14 and 11 percent respectively.</p>
<p>it's pretty clear that the BJP (the largest yellow circle) not only has the largest share of women in the Lok Sabha, they also have geographic monopolies (purple dots that they own). When you consider that about half of the parties on this list are part of their ruling alliance, you can see why the BJP feels comfortable alienating the opposition.</p>
