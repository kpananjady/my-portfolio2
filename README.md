# Welcome to my portfolio's repository site! 

This site uses the Sawhorse templating system developed by my professor, Jonathan Soma. You can read more about that here. https://github.com/jsoma/sample-netlify-project

Feel free to use any of the data that I have cleaned up here. In some cases, analysis notebooks have been too big to upload to Github, but if you shoot me a line at k.pananjady@gmail.com I'd be down to share them with you. 

Feedback always appreciated.
