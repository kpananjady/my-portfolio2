  This line means, use default.hbs layout from src/html/layouts/
-->




{{!< default}}

{{> story/access/nyc-map }}

<!-- 
  Put some content into an .hbs file inside of /partials, 
  and you can just throw it in anywhere!
-->



<!-- 
  Charts are exactly the same.

<!-- 
  If you want to use something exported from ai2html...
    1. Rename the exported .html file to .hbs
    2. Put the .hbs file inside of 'html/story'
    3. Move the exported images to the images folder
    4. Include the partial normally like below
  -->


<!--
  You can also put the actual HTML here if you really want to,
  although it's a little less organized looking
-->

<div class="story-body">
   
</div>

<style>
  .sticky {
    position: -webkit-sticky;
    position: sticky;
    top: 0;
