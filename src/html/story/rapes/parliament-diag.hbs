    <p>This data does not include the 2012 gangrape in Delhi. It also does not include the vet who was raped and burned in Hyderabad this month, nor does it include the woman who was raprd and burned by her alleged rapists on the way to testify at her rape hearing this month. Rapes that result in murder do not figure here, as the Indian government subsumes them under the more general category of homicides. As such, it is actually difficult to fully understand just how deadly rape in India can be. If there's one thing that I've learned in graduate school, it's that not counting something often amounts to being able to understand it.</p>

    <p>In the aftermath of the 2012 Delhi gangrape, female MPs were some of the most vocal advocates for change. This time around, MPs have been accused of politicizing the issue and alienating those across the aisle — particularly when Smriti Irani said that opposition leader Rahul Gandhi condoned rape by mentioning the words and in the same breath condemning the prime minister's silence on the matter. Here's a representation of what polarization looks like among women in parliament — represented by the yellow dots — and what opportunities for regional coalition building that may exist, represented by the purple dots. Circle are sized based on the number of edges going in and out of each node; also it's worth pointing out that while the absolute numbers of women MPs might differ between the two major parties, the BJP and the Congress, as a percentage of ther members the parties are not so far apart at 14 and 11 percent respectively.</p>
